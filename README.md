## Exploratorium

### Summary

Exploratorium is a container for exploratory data analysis microprojects I've worked on. Ideally, the reports will follow the [OSEMN](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) approach to data science. 

Each report itself is self-contained within its sub-directory, so feel free to check them out below!
