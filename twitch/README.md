# Viewership on Twitch

Hi there! I got a great view of some 2013 Twitch live-stream data. I wrote up the results of my analysis over on my [website](http://datafra.me/blog/twitch-analysis) – it has purple-themed plots and jokes for days. Go check it out plz ☺️

This repository, like the rest, will serve to provide the dataset, source code, and anything else I might happen to use/need. I'm a big fan of just cloning a repo and having things work, so I'll aim for *that* level of simplicity.

Have fun! Feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dataframing) if something's not right/I forgot anything.
