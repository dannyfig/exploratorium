## Exploring Modern Terrorism

Hi kind stranger(s),

This report contains analysis done on the University of Maryland's [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), which is a research effort dedicated towards documenting incidents of modern terrorism.

Due to size constraints I can't add the source CSV used in this analysis, but I sourced my data using [Enigma's public data platform](https://app.enigma.io/table/edu.umd.start.gtd). All code and findings are written by yours truly.

To view my report, check out the [report](http://rpubs.com/dataframe_/terrorism) hosted on RPubs. Otherwise, this repository holds everything pertaining to this analysis, including:

* **R**: any code used to load, transform, and visualize the dataset; if you'd rather run the code than read the report, feel free to check out `analysis.R`

* **docs**: reports generated by RMarkdown; contains both HTML and native RMarkdown formats (if you're interested in the exact code used for generating the report it's in `report.Rmd`)

* **README.md**: what you're reading right now :)

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch at <danny.vilela@nyu.edu>. Thanks!
