# Analyzing NYC SAT scores

Hey! For one of my earlier analyses I chose to look at NYC SAT scores across public high schools. I wrote up the results of my analysis over on my [website](http://datafra.me) – it has pretty pictures and everything! Go check it out ☺️

This repository, like the rest, will serve to provide the dataset, source code, and anything else I might happen to use/need. I'm a big fan of just cloning a repo and having things work, so I'll aim for *that* level of simplicity.

Have fun! Feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dataframing) if something's not right/I forgot something.
