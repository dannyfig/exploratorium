# Analyzing NYC Restaurant Violations

Hey! I did a bit of a deep-dive on NYC Restaurant hygiene grades. I wrote up the results of my analysis over on my [website](http://datafra.me/blog/Calling-out-NYC-restaurant-violations) â€“ it's got tables on tables and plots for days. It's <del>probably</del> well worth your time!

This repository, like the rest, will serve to provide the dataset, source code, and anything else I might happen to use/need. I'm a big fan of just cloning a repo and having things work, so I'll aim for *that* level of simplicity.

Have fun! Feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dataframing) if something's not right/I forgot anything.
